# Project overview

This is an overview of the projects I developed during my four semesters at the Hochschule Harz. This overview will focus primarily on my computer science classes.

## 1. Semester ##

###### Java programming ######

Every week in the first Semester, we had to solve a specific task. The solutions were necessary to pass the exam. Therefor we had to work together in groups of two people. The tasks where basic exercises to learn Java

One of these task was to generate a GUI with 500 x 500 px. After that the program should position 20 points randomly on the interface. The user should now have the opportunity, to choose between different comparison methods. After the comparison the program should connect the dots depending on the distance. 
The comparison methods:

• Lexicographically: first the X-coordinate, if they are the same, the Y-coordinate

• Lexicographically: first the Y coordinate, if it is the same, the X coordinate

• Compare the distance of the points to the origin

• Comparison of the distance of the points to the center of the drawing area


For my solution I used the *Scanner* to ask the user for the comparison method.

A new class *Zeichenflaeche* created the GUI with the JFrame extension.

Another class was used to create different methods for the varying comparison methods. As an example you can see the solution for the first lexicographically comparison.

###### HTML and CSS ######

The first website was a standard non responsive HTML and CSS side with some JavaScript. The topic was self-selectable. I decided to create a website for the Netflix-series *Tales by Light*. The website contained a menu and three subpages.

Additionally I added a video-player and a slideshow, to represent the images of the photographers.
